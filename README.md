### 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 Purpose of the System

The main objective of the E-COMMERCE WEBSITE is to manage the details of Products, Customer, Payment, and Category.

#### 1.2 Scope of the System

Customers get many benefits via online shopping. This helps e-commerce companies to build long-lasting and profitable relationships with their customers.

### 2. Current System

The purpose of this Website is to reduce the cost and effort to maintain the website for the administrator.

### 3. Limitations
This application does not have a built-in check out process. An external checkout
package has to be integrated into this application. Also users cannot save the shopping
carts so that they can access later i.e. they cannot create wish lists which they can
access later. This application does not have features by which users can set price
ranges for products and receive alerts once the price reaches the particular range.
Users canâ€™t see the orders they ordered.


### Scope for Future Work

The following enhancements and features can be implemented in the future:

- The current system can be extended to allow users to create accounts and save products into wishlists.

- Users could subscribe to price alerts, enabling them to receive messages when prices for products fall below a particular level.

- The current system, which currently focuses on the shopping cart process, can be extended to include an easy-to-use checkout process.

- Users can have multiple shipping and billing information saved. During checkout, they can use the drag-and-drop feature to select shipping and billing information.
